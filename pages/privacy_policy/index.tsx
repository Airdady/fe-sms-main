                The right of data portability
                <br />
                <br />
                Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf
                (this includes an authorized agent), may make a verifiable
                consumer request (“request”) related to your personal
                information. You may only make a request for access or data
                portability twice within a 12-month period. An authorized agent
                making a request on your behalf must provide us with written
                authorization providing the agent with the ability to make a
                request signed by you. Additionally, you will need to verify
                your identity directly with us. Please note that this authorized
                agent requirement is not applicable when the authorized agent
                has a power of attorney. The request must: (1) provide
                sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you
                are the person about whom we collected personal information or
                an authorized representative; and (2) describes your request
                with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
                evaluate, and respond to it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Any disclosures we provide will cover the 12-month period
                preceding receipt of the request. We will provide a response to
                a request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we
                reasonably require an extension of time, we will notify you
                within the first forty-five (45) day period and such extension
                will not exceed an additional forty-five (45) days. We will not
                discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights. Any
                personal information provided to us for verification and
                fraud-prevention purposes will only be used for that purpose and
                such information will be deleted as soon as practical after
                processing of your request.
                <br />
                <br />
                Please Note, You will not have to pay a fee to access your
                Personal Data or to exercise any of your rights listed above.
                However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request, in our
                sole opinion, is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
                Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in
                these circumstances. Also, to help us to progress your request,
                we may need to request specific information from you to confirm
                your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data
                or to exercise any of your above listed rights. This is a
                security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed
                to any person who has no right to receive it. We will try to
                respond to all legitimate requests within one month of receipt
                of the request. Occasionally, it could take us longer than a
                month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a
                number of requests, in which case, we will notify you and keep
                you updated on progress made.
                <br />
                <br />

                We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably
                necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including
                the purposes to provide you with services, or satisfying any
                legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We
                may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event
                of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect

                <br />
                <br />
                To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
                we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal
                data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
                disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
                process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
                purposes through other means and the applicable legal,
                regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. After
                expiration of the applicable retention periods, your personal
                data will be deleted or anonymized. If there is any personal
                data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete
                entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate
                measures to prevent any further use of such personal data. To
                improve our services, we may aggregate and anonymize your
                personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you),
                in which case we may use such aggregated and anonymized
                information indefinitely without further notice to you.
