                  progress over perfection.

                    At AirDady success is not measured in profits alone but
                    rather in the contributions to all stakeholders; our team,
                    customers, end-users, partners, the community, and the
                    planet. We are honest, tolerant, and inclusive. We all
                    commit to creating a safe working environment. We protect
                    each otherâ€™s time as well as our own.

                    We communicate with our team, customers, users, and
                    end-users in a clear, timely, and open way. We do not shy
                    away from crucial conversations. We give each other
                    radically  feedback and never wait to do so. We
                    understand that this can feel uncomfortable.  We have the
                    courage to speak up and challenge each other. Asking
                    questions or reaching out for help are acts of strength, not
                    weakness.
